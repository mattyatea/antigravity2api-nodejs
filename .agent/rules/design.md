### Design Thinking Principles & Constraints (Mandatory)

* **Monochrome only**

  * Use strictly black, white, and grayscale
  * No color-based meaning, emphasis, or decoration
  * The design must work identically in pure black & white

* **Always prioritize readability**

  * Readability outweighs aesthetics in all decisions
  * Structure must be understandable at a glance
  * Emphasize spacing, contrast, hierarchy, and font size
  * Avoid visual noise and cognitive overload

* **Function over decoration**

  * No decorative elements without a clear purpose
  * Visuals must serve understanding, not style
  * Faster comprehension is the primary success metric

* **Progressive complexity**

  * Present the overall structure first
  * Details should appear only when necessary
  * Avoid exposing full complexity upfront

* **Robust across environments**

  * Must remain clear in low resolution, small screens, and print
  * Must not rely on color perception or display quality
  * Monochrome printing must preserve all meaning
